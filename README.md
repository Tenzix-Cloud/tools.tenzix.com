## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) with PHP.
- Basic knowledge of web server configuration

### Installation Guide

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Upload the files to your web server.
3. Configure any necessary dependencies as per the documentation.

## Roadmap

Our planned features include:

- Network tools like a ping tool, open port checker, and IP/WHOIS/BGP lookup.
- Utilities such as a CRON calculator, data transfer calculator, and CHMOD helper.
- Web tools like htaccess/htpasswd generator, character counter, and link shortener.

## Todo List

- Refine the UI with pico.css.
- Development and integration of all planned tools.
- Evaluating and potentially removing less useful features.
